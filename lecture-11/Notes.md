# Performance
>How quickly and efficiently something works

## Trade-offs
>In most cases, optimization is not worth the cost in complexity and maintainability

## Measuring Performance
1. React Native Perf Monitor
2. Chrome Performance Monitor

## Common Inefficiencies
1. Rerendering too often
2. Unnecessarily changing props
3. Unnecessarily logic in mount/update

## Reminder
>Don't over-optimize until a bottleneck is found

## Side note
>Animations with Animated Library to declare a computation in JS and compute it on the native thread
